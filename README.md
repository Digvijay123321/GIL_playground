# GIL Playground

A hands-on Python playground to explore the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**.  
Run small, focused scripts to see when the GIL matters, when it doesnâ€™t, and how to work around it.

## ðŸ“Œ Planning on adding

- **Basics** â€“ Simple examples to show GIL behavior.         (âœ… completed)
- **Benchmarks** â€“ CPU-bound vs I/O-bound performance.       (âœ… completed)
- **Advanced** â€“ NumPy, multiprocessing, and GIL internals.  (ðŸ“‹ inprogress)
- **Notes** â€“ Links and explanations for deeper learning.    (ðŸ“‹ inprogress)
